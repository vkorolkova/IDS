# Intrusion Detection System

Machine learning-based intrusion detection approaches have attracted increasing attention in the network intrusion detection research area because of their intrinsic capabilities in discovering novel attacks. 

In this paper I propose using methods based on machine learning for discovering novel attacks and classification known atacs  in intrusion detection. I consider 

Results obtained by applying this approach to the NSL-KDD  dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach performs high determination accuracy.
